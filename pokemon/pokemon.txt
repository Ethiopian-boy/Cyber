#####To solve POKEMON 

1) nmap scaning 
      
          [nmap -sC -sV IP]


then we will find the ssh is open and so we gonna use it.
=> As wecan see from the cource code we have this '<pokemon>:<hack_the_pokemon>'

the now we gonna use ssh 
*************************************************
    TO activate ss] shell =>[sudo systemctl enable ssh]
                          =>[sudo systemctl start ssh]

2)to get into pokemon:-

        [ssh pokemon@IP]

        * as password: 'hack_the_pokemon'

then by typing 'yes'  we gonna get into the  'pokemona@' directory

            [ls]
            [cd Desktop]
            [ls]
            [unzip P0kemon.zip]
            [ls]
            [cd P0kemon/]
            [ls]
            [cat grass-type.txt]
    BOOM! we found  '50 6f 4b 65 4d 6f 4e 7b 42 75 6c 62 61 73 61 75 72 7d'
    ===> So now we need to convert it on 'cyberchef'
    and submit it

    then ====> 
          we gonna use command to come back from privous directory

          [cd]
          [find / -name water-type.txt 2> /dev/null]

  BOOOM! again we found 'Ecgudfxq_EcGmP{Ecgudfxq}' so now we need to convert it on 'cyberchif' by making/ choosing 'rot' and once it coverted we will submit i

  ===> then we need to use command to fin 'Videos' folder

          [ls]
          [cd Videos]
          [ls]
          [cd Gotta]
          [ls]
          [cd Them]
          [ls]
          [cd ALL!]
          [ls]
          [cat Could_this_be_what_Im_looking_for?.cplusplus]

Wow we have got the root accessing hint
   THIS "# include <iostream>

          int main() {
      	std::cout << "ash : pikapika"
	          return 0;
"

===> ona command line again 

     [cd ect]
     [ls]
     [cd why_am_i_here?]
     [ls]
     [cat fire-type.txt]

BOOOM! we have found 'UDBrM20wbntDaGFybWFuZGVyfQ==' so again we need to convert it, then submit it

======

  ON Newtab of commandline
   we gonna use 'ssh'
--------------------------------

            [ssh ash@IP]
            [whoami]
            [ls]
            [cd /home]
            [ls]
            [cat roots-pokemon.txt]

       WOW! we foun 'pikachu!'

Done!!!
